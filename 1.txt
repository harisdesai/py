Design a premium, interactive web page to surprise my best friend on their birthday.
The theme should be elegant, modern, and emotionally touching, with classy animations, parallax effects, and smooth transitions. The landing page opens with a cinematic animation—like a gift box slowly opening or a starry sky parting—leading to a heartfelt birthday message.

Include the following sections:

Hero Section: Fullscreen animated intro with soft orchestral music (optional mute/unmute), displaying "Happy Birthday [Friend's Name]" with elegant motion typography.

Memory Lane: A horizontal scroll section with floating photo frames and short captions. Use smooth parallax scrolling and subtle particle effects (like sparkles or golden confetti).

Messages from Loved Ones: A carousel of video or audio wishes, each in a stylish card with 3D hover effects.

Countdown to a Surprise Reveal: A sleek countdown timer with shimmering effects, revealing a hidden heartfelt letter or a digital gift (e.g. video montage, custom poem, or curated playlist).

Ending Section: A dreamy “Thank You for Being You” message with animated handwritten font and a touch of glittering stardust animation. Optionally, have a button to download all the memories as a PDF or video.

Design Style: Dark mode with soft gold and rose accents. Use smooth micro-interactions, subtle shadows, and glassmorphism or neumorphism for a high-end feel. Add sound-reactive or scroll-based animations for extra flair.
